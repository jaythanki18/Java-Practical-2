//(Subclasses of Account) In Programming Exercise 2, the Account class was defined to model a bank account.
// An account has the properties account number, balance, annual interest rate, and date created, and methods to deposit and withdraw funds.
// Create two subclasses for checking and saving accounts.
// A checking account has an overdraft limit, but a savings account cannot be overdrawn.
// Draw the UML diagram for the classes and then implement them.
// Write a test program that creates objects of Account, SavingsAccount, and CheckingAccount and invokes their toString() methods
